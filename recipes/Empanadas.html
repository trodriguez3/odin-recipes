    <h2>The Best Homemade Puerto Rican Empanadas</h2>
     <p> A standard food in any Puerto Rican household, Pastelillos are super easy to make and seriously delicious. Whether you have unexpected guests over, are in the mood for a quick snack or dinner – these Spanish turnovers are the perfect solution. My kids love them and my husband grew up on them. Here’s how to make them!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package of Goya flour discs (white) (makes 10 pastelillos) – defrosted (found in freezer section)</li>
            <li>2 TBSP Sofrito (see basic recipe below)</li>
            <li>1 packet chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>Goya Adobo (to taste)</li>
            <li>Small can Goya Tomato Sauce (8 oz)</li>
            <li>1 packet of Sazon Goya Con Culantro y Achiote</li>
            <li>1 packet Sazon Sin Achiote</li>
            <li>1 small potato cut finely into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 lb Ground Meat (can use chicken, beef, turkey – my family prefers beef)</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil (for frying)</li>
                </ul>
    <h3>Sofrito</h3>
        <p>Combine bunch of cilantro, 1 yellow onion, 1 green and red pepper, and garlic in food processor until blended finely. Keep in container in the fridge to use for cooking. Can be frozen for larger batches.</p>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In pot place ground beef, sofrito, 1 package of Sazon Goya Con Culantro y Achiote, Goya Chicken Bouillon Packet, Sazon Goya Sin Achiote, tomato sauce, potatoes and bring to boil. Spoon grease from meat off top.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, simmer on low until meat absorbs all moisture and mixture is incorporated. </li>
            <li>Place defrosted disc on plate and spoon meat mixture into the middle of the disc.</li>
            <li>Fold disc over in half.</li>
            <li>Using a fork, seal folded sides together pressing fork into disc.</li>
            <li>Fry disc in heated oil until brown on both sides.</li>
            <li>Place on paper towel to drain excess oil and ENJOY!</li>
            <p>To make pastelillos to eat later on in the week, place in aluminum pan and line with wax paper from flour disc packaging. Place 1 pastelillo, wax paper over it, then overlap with next pastelillo (see insert). Can be kept in freezer for up to 2 weeks. When ready to eat, simply take out of freezer, place in hot oil, cook until brown on both sides and enjoy. They are not the healthiest of foods – but they are super delicious and really easy to make. If you make these – let me know how they taste!</p>
