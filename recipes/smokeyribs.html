    <h2>How To Make Smoked BBQ Ribs</h2>
    <p>Smoky, sticky, falling-off-the-bone ribs are easier than you think. Just cook them long and slow -- on the grill or in the oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks baby back pork ribs (about 2 1/2 pounds total)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed dark-brown sugar</li>
        <li>Coarse salt and ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons smoked or sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped chipotle chiles in adobo</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the ribs: Depending on how the butcher has trimmed the ribs, there may be a tough, rubbery membrane on the underside. If so, score meat between bones (being careful not to cut the meat) and pull membrane away.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, 1/3 cup salt, 1 teaspoon ground pepper, Cajun seasoning, paprika, cayenne, and ground mustard. Reserve half the rub for later use (store in an airtight container, up to a month). Working with 1 rack at a time, lay a large piece of parchment-lined foil on a work surface, place rack on parchment, and liberally coat both sides with rub.</li>
        <li>Fold foil and parchment around ribs, crimping the edges together to form a packet.</li>
        <li>Stir together chili sauce, chipotle chiles, and honey.</li>
        <li>Set up grill for indirect cooking: arrange heat source (charcoal or gas) on one side of grill and heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Place rib packets on cooler side of grill, standing them upright on long sides. Cover grill and cook until a knife can pierce meat with no resistance, about 2 1/2 hours (if using a charcoal grill, add a couple handfuls of coals every half hour to maintain 300 degrees).</li>
        <li>Remove ribs from grill, unwrap, and brush with chipotle sauce. If using a charcoal grill, lift grate to carefully spread out hot coals. On a gas grill, place ribs directly over heat source. Grill until sauce is bubbling and ribs are lightly charred, 2 minutes per side, brushing with more sauce if desired.</li>
        <li>To cook in the oven, preheat oven to 300 degrees. Place rib packets on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until a knife can pierce meat with no resistance, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove ribs from oven. Heat broiler. Unwrap ribs, place on sheet, and brush with chipotle sauce.</li>
        <li>Broil until sauce is bubbling and ribs are lightly charred, about 5 minutes, brushing with more sauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This recipe makes a double batch of the spice rub. Use the extra to season chicken, pork, or steak before grilling. The homemade sauce gets its smokiness from chipotle chiles in adobo; look for them in the international aisle.</p>
