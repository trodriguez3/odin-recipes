    <h2>Mac N Cheese like a pro</h2>
     <p>When I say ultimate mac and cheese, I’m not joking. In fact, “ultimate” might be an understatement. This 3 cheese mac and cheese is insanely creamy and cheesy, but not in an artificial, Velveeta way.  This macaroni gratin has depth and a little tingle. Who doesn’t like a little tingle? And this old fashioned mac and cheese isn’t for people who hem and haw about calories, fat or a “proper serving size” (Mom, I’m talking to YOU).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Macaroni</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>White Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>Jarlsberg Cheese</li>
        <li>Parmegiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>Regular Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>Dry Mustard</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>White Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Confit (optional, but good)</li>
        <li>Parsley (To make it look healthier than it is)</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
     <h4>Making the Pasta</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Read the package directions on the pasta to determine how long it needs to cook for al dente — then 
                SUBTRACT 2 minutes. That’s how long you’ll boil the macaroni. When it’s done, drain it, toss with a
                little olive oil and spread the noodles in an even layer on a shallow pan to cool.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the cream, dry mustard, white pepper, cayenne and garlic confit in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil. The cream will bubble furiously and rise up the sides of the pan, but will subside on its own. Reduce the heat to simmer and let it cook for about 2 minutes to thicken slightly and reduce.</li>
            <li>Add the cooked pasta to the cream sauce and continue to cook, stirring continuously for two minutes to release the starch from the macaroni and have the cream cling to the noodles.</li>
            <li>Add about half of the total cheese blend in small amounts to the pot, stirring constantly. Don’t add more cheese until the previous handful has melted into the sauce.</li>
                </ol>
     <h4>Making the Gratin</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the cheese coated pasta into a small baking dish.</li>
            <li>Cover with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Slip the pan under the broiler and cook until golden and bubbly (turning the dish once or twice to avoid overcooking in any one area).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>let it rest for about 5 minutes before digging into the casserole. This is the gooey-est, cheesiest, most decadent, truly ULTIMATE mac and cheese ever. When I served this, not a word was spoken at dinner. </p>
